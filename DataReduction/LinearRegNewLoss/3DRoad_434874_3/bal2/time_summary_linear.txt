Linear regression 3droad ds:
Q3.pt
    size 174400,3
    time N/A - (should be extremely fast)
coresets:
    sizes [50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140]
    reps 10
    time per coreset (10 reps) ~1:20:00
    time per run 14:51:27
        * includes weak and strong test (about 2 hours)
    * all time measurements include many redundant actions for debug

NOTICE if a specific log show slower time measurements, it's more than likely it was running parallel to more
experiments, hence time is slower
