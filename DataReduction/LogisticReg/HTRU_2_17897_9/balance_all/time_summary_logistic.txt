Logistic regression HTRU_2 ds:
Q.pt
    size 20000,9
    time 00:02:52 (extremely fast)
coresets:
    sizes [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
    reps 5
    time per coreset (5 reps) ~12:30:00
    time per run estimation about 62:30:00
    * all time measurements include many redundant actions for debug

NOTICE if a specific log show slower time measurements, it's more than likely it was running parallel to more
experiments, hence time is slower
