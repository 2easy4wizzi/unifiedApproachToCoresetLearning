sklearn on A_train -> get loss (should be the loss on q_opt)
vs our loss on q opt
Murad Corset for near convex function
check if svm is "new loss" or normal
check if i normalize the weights

1 next exp - add trainable W
2 with 1, add new loss func
3 build better Q2
4 start with the worst c_init (4th)




3d PLOT of lin data
    P
    C (if C far from P -> CU or C*squart(U))

3d plot of HTRU_2
    PCA to 3 or 2
    same like above

time for Q and for C
