SVM HTRU_2 ds:
Q.pt
    size 20000,9
    time 0:01:55 (extremely fast)
coresets:
    sizes [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800]
    reps 5
    time per coreset (5 reps) ~03:30:00
    time per run estimation about 21:00:00
    * all time measurements include many redundant actions for debug

NOTICE if a specific log show slower time measurements, it's more than likely it was running parallel to more
experiments, hence time is slower

Difference between svm and logistic is substantial despite same data size. the main reasons are:
    * in logistic we could have achieved the same results with a lower epoch number (1000 vs 200 in svm)
    * found optimization that cut epoch run time in 3 way after finishing logistic
